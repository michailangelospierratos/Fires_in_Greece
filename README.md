# Fires in Greece 2017-2021 

## Overview-Objectives
This project is an attempt to analyze the data of wildfires in Greece during the period 2017-2021. This project was motivated by the devastating severity of the recent wildfires in Greece during the summer of 2021 in places such as Evia, Attiki and Elia. The insights I try to extract from the data are: 
### **Descriptive analysis/Historical trends**
* The general trend of the severity of fires in Greece in these last years
* The total land that has been burnt from these fires
### **Descriptive analysis/Diagnostic analysis**
* The most dangerous times of the day and months for severe fires
* Probability of severe fires in different regions of Greece
* The response of the fire departments across Greece


## Findings
From the analysis of the data we come to the following conclusions for each of the questions investigated:
### **Historical insights**
The years 2017-2020 were relatively mild for wildfires, whereas Greece experienced a 500% increase in the total land burnt in 2021, with the most severe fires taking place in Evia, Attiki, and Elia. In the last 5 year period 1.4% of Greece was burnt in these wildfires, while the worst fire of 2021 burnt a devastating 14% of the region of Evia.
### **Danger factors and prevention approach**
Quiet expectedly the summer months are the most dangerous for severe fires erupting. More interestingly, the most dangerous times of the day are both the higher temperature evening hours as well as the midnight hours when fire departments are at their most unprepared state.\
The probability of severe fires increases significantly in districts that have experienced severe fires before, which probably indicates their natural susceptibility to severe fires. The latter should therefore become the priority of the greek fire department whose response at the last year's devastating wildfires has been the same as it was in 2020, when the fires were significantly less severe. The small number of the greek firefighting dynamic might also have caused an avalanche effect of new uncontrolled fires becoming severe when the former was mostly concentrated in other areas.
